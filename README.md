# Source Code 

- The sub folder [*/MGM*](./MGM/) contains the Python version of MGM implementation.
- The sub folder [*/DL*](./DL/) contains the Python implemenation of DeepPINK procedure (knockoff data generation, DNN, and FDR).
- The sub folder [*/causal*](./causal/) contains the Python implementation of DG procedure.

# Example

#### The source code Example.ipynb demonstrates how to use causalDeepVASE.
